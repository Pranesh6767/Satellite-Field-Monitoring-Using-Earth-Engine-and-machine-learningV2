# Satellite-Field-Monitoring-Using-Earth-Engine-and-machine-learningV2
This Python code will analyse the quality of field from 10 years data of MSAVI, NDVI, NDWI indices. We have designed Earth Engine Application to download spectrum data in the format of csv. Python code snippet will import that data and will calculate field parameters and it will predict the quality of field. For that we have implemented K-means clustering algorithm.
